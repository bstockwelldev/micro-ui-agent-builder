# MicroUIAgentBuilder-FutureAIStack-ContextualPRD

## 0) Context-grounded instruction outline

- Establish a migration target: **Next.js App Router + Vercel AI SDK v6 UI streaming + LangGraph orchestration + Langfuse observability** while preserving current product surface (Flows, Run, GenUI, Tools, MCP).
- Keep changes server-first for runtime internals (`app/api/*`, `lib/server/*`) and maintain existing client chat contract (`@ai-sdk/react` + stream transport).
- Introduce orchestration and observability as composable adapters to avoid coupling core route handlers to one implementation.
- Validate with existing quality gates (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`) and define explicit rollout acceptance criteria.

## 1) Problem statement and goals

### Current baseline (from repo)

- Streaming runtime is concentrated in `POST /api/agent/run` using `streamText`, flow preflight, dynamic tools, model resolution, and finish hooks for analytics logs.
- Structured GenUI runtime is exposed via `POST /api/agent/genui` using `generateObject` and shared Zod schema.
- Client chat UX already uses AI SDK UI primitives (`useChat`, `DefaultChatTransport`) and supports tool approval UX and inline GenUI rendering.
- Observability exists as local JSONL run analytics (`appendRunAnalyticsRecord`) and dashboard aggregation; no external tracing layer is present.

### Target outcomes

1. Preserve existing chat UX and streaming behavior while moving orchestration logic into a LangGraph-compatible execution layer.
2. Add Langfuse trace/span/generation telemetry for run + genui routes without exposing secrets client-side.
3. Keep AI SDK v6 as the transport/UI abstraction to minimize front-end churn.
4. Keep flow document schemas backward-compatible while enabling optional graph-derived execution metadata.

### Non-goals

- Replacing the current Studio flow editor data model.
- Replacing `@repo/shared` GenUI schema contracts.
- Introducing client-side secret handling or browser-side tracing ingestion.

## 2) Proposed architecture (incremental)

### A. Runtime layering

- **Presentation layer (unchanged first):** `RunChatConversation` + AI SDK UI transport.
- **API boundary (minimal change):** existing route handlers remain entry points.
- **Execution adapter (new):** `lib/server/orchestration/*` with an interface:
  - `executeChatRun(request): AsyncIterable<UIMessageChunk>`
  - `executeGenuiRun(request): Promise<GenuiSurface>`
- **Implementation v1:** wraps existing `streamText`/`generateObject` behavior.
- **Implementation v2:** LangGraph-backed adapter preserving input/output shapes.

### B. Observability layering

- **Telemetry adapter (new):** `lib/server/telemetry/*` abstraction:
  - `startRunTrace`, `recordModelCall`, `recordToolCall`, `finishRunTrace`, `captureError`.
- **Implementation v1:** no-op + existing JSONL analytics.
- **Implementation v2:** Langfuse implementation with environment-gated activation.

### C. Data contracts

- Maintain current request contracts for:
  - `/api/agent/run` (`messages`, `flowId?`, `agentId?`, `preferOllama?`)
  - `/api/agent/genui` (`instruction`, `flowId?`, `agentId?`)
- Add optional metadata fields only when strictly additive (e.g., `orchestrationVersion`, `traceId`) and keep clients tolerant.

## 3) Current implementation status

### Orchestration flags — single source of truth

| Variable | Allowed values | Purpose | Current effect |
|----------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND` | `ai_sdk` (default), `langgraph` | Runtime config gate for route execution backend selection. | `ai_sdk` executes via current AI SDK path. `langgraph` is currently **fail-closed** for route execution until a LangGraph executor is shipped. |
| `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_EXECUTOR` | `current-ai-sdk` (default), `next-ai-sdk` | Internal executor selector used by orchestration resolver. | Both values currently resolve to the same `CurrentAiSdkOrchestrationExecutor` implementation (AI SDK executor contract parity flag). |
| `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` | non-empty URL | LangGraph endpoint for remote execution. | Required when `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=langgraph`; missing value fails closed. |
| `LANGGRAPH_API_KEY` | non-empty secret | LangGraph auth for remote execution. | Required when `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=langgraph`; missing value fails closed. |

**Precedence note**

1. `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND` is evaluated first and gates route backend eligibility.
2. `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_EXECUTOR` is only relevant when backend resolution stays on the AI SDK path.
3. If backend resolution is `langgraph` before LangGraph executor support exists (or required LangGraph env is missing), startup/request execution fails closed; executor selector does not override that gate.

**Startup behavior examples (missing/invalid values)**

- `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND` unset → defaults to `ai_sdk`; runtime uses AI SDK execution path.
- `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=invalid` → runtime rejects backend config (503 fail-closed) with remediation guidance.
- `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=langgraph` with missing `LANGGRAPH_API_URL` or `LANGGRAPH_API_KEY` → fail-closed (503) with explicit missing-variable guidance.
- `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_EXECUTOR` unset → defaults to `current-ai-sdk`.
- `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_EXECUTOR=unknown` with `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=ai_sdk` → resolver falls back to `current-ai-sdk`.

**Migration note (when `langgraph-executor.ts` is introduced)**

- After `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/langgraph-executor.ts` is added, update this table so `ORCHESTRATION_BACKEND=langgraph` maps to the real executor path, document any new `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_EXECUTOR` values, and keep `ai_sdk` as rollback target until parity checks pass.

### Workstream status snapshot

## 4) Change-set plan with workstreams

### WS-01 — Orchestration abstraction and parity harness

- Build a stable orchestration interface around current server logic.
- Add parity checks to ensure output/tool behavior matches current routes.

### WS-02 — LangGraph execution backend

- Implement LangGraph executor for chat/genui workflows.
- Map existing flow preflight + tool registration + model selection into graph nodes.

### WS-03 — Langfuse telemetry backend

- Add server-only telemetry adapter and emit traces/spans around route executions and tool/model calls.

#### Langfuse event contract

This contract defines the minimum telemetry shape required to correlate a single Run/GenUI request across API logs, model events, and tool execution.

**Trace lifecycle (`beginRouteTrace` → `finishTrace`)**

1. **Trace start** (`beginRouteTrace`) initializes `traceId` (request header `x-trace-id` or generated UUID) and `runId`, then calls `telemetry.startTrace(...)` with `kind`, `flowId`, `agentId`, and `runId`.
   - Source: `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/with-trace.ts`
2. **Route/model/tool execution** emits model and tool events from the AI SDK executor.
   - Source: `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`
3. **Error path** (`failTrace` or explicit catch blocks) records `trace_error` via `captureError(...)` then closes the trace with `finishTrace(..., "error")`.
   - Sources: `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/with-trace.ts`, `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`
4. **Success path** closes trace with `finishTrace(..., "ok")` and duration metadata.
   - Source: `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`

**Emitted event names and producers**

- `model_preflight` — emitted by `recordModelEvent({ phase: "preflight" })` in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`; event naming materialized in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`.
- `model_selection` — emitted by `recordModelEvent({ phase: "model_selection" })` in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`; event naming materialized in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`.
- `model_generation_start` — emitted by `recordModelEvent({ phase: "generation_start" })` in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`; event naming materialized in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`.
- `model_generation_finish` — emitted by `recordModelEvent({ phase: "generation_finish" })` in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`; event naming materialized in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`.
- `tool_*` (`tool_tool_call_start`, `tool_tool_call_finish`, `tool_tool_call_error`) — emitted by tool wrappers in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/tool-wrap.ts`; event naming materialized in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`; wrapper integration occurs in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`.
- `trace_error` — emitted by `captureError(...)` in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/langfuse.ts`; invoked from `failTrace(...)` in `apps/web/lib/server/telemetry/with-trace.ts` and explicit executor catch blocks in `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/current-ai-sdk-executor.ts`.

**Minimum required debugging correlation fields**

Every trace/event payload must include enough metadata to join telemetry with request and analytics logs.

- `traceId` (required): primary correlation key across API response metadata (`x-trace-id` / response metadata) and telemetry.
- `runId` (required): per-request execution identifier generated at route start.
- `flowId` (required, nullable): flow context for route-level grouping.
- `agentId` (required, nullable): agent context for route-level grouping.
- Provider/model labels (required on model events):
  - `providerLabel` (selected execution provider)
  - `modelRef` (requested/resolved model reference)
  - `fallbackProviderLabel` (when fallback path is available/used)

Implementation note: `startTrace` currently seeds `flowId` and `agentId` as `null` in `beginRouteTrace`; preserving these keys as explicit nullable fields is part of the contract.

### WS-04 — Progressive rollout + fallback controls

- Add feature flags for executor and telemetry selection with safe default behavior.
- Keep rollback path to current runtime.

### WS-05 — QA, reliability, and deployment hardening

- Extend tests for adapter behavior and run/build checks.
- Validate Vercel/serverless compatibility and secret scoping.

## 6) Acceptance criteria

### Met now

- **AC-01:** Existing Run chat UX streams responses and tool calls without front-end API contract changes.
- **AC-02:** GenUI route still validates against shared schema and returns same top-level JSON envelope.
- **AC-04:** Langfuse telemetry can be enabled/disabled by configuration with no impact when disabled.
- **AC-05:** Existing analytics JSONL pipeline remains functional during migration.

### Blocked / pending

- **AC-03:** LangGraph executor can be enabled/disabled by configuration with deterministic fallback.  
  _Blocked pending WS-02 implementation; `apps/web/lib/server/orchestration/langgraph-executor.ts` is not present yet._
- **AC-06:** Root quality gates pass in CI and local dev.  
  _Pending full migration completion and verification run for all workstreams._

## 7) Risks and mitigations

- **Risk:** Streaming semantics diverge between current direct `streamText` and LangGraph runner.
  - **Mitigation:** WS-01 parity harness + golden route fixtures before enabling WS-02 by default.
- **Risk:** Duplicate telemetry (JSONL + Langfuse) or missing trace correlation.
  - **Mitigation:** central telemetry adapter with explicit event mapping and traceId propagation.
- **Risk:** Tool approval or MCP tool naming behavior regresses.
  - **Mitigation:** preserve existing tool name normalization and approval event payload contracts.

## 8) Test-first rollout matrix

- **Pre-change baseline tests:** snapshot current route behavior (success, preflight fail, provider fail, tool output).
- **Migration tests:** run same fixtures with LangGraph executor and compare envelope + error shape.
- **Regression tests:** verify existing dashboards still compute from JSONL analytics records.
- **Deployment tests:** Vercel preview with and without Supabase; ensure no server secret leaks to client bundle.

## 9) Improvement proposal backlog (grounded)

- `#refactor` Extract route runtime internals into server services to reduce `route.ts` complexity and improve testability.
- `#tech-debt` Replace ad-hoc `console.log` events with structured telemetry adapter events to align analytics + tracing.
- `#upkeep` Consolidate provider/env capability checks into a single documented configuration contract.
- `#other` Add explicit orchestration state schema for run lifecycle transitions (queued, preflight, model, tool, complete, failed).

## 10) Open questions (required before implementation)

1. Should LangGraph be the default executor immediately after parity, or staged by environment (dev/staging/prod)?
2. Is Langfuse self-hosted or cloud, and what data retention/privacy constraints apply to prompt/tool payload capture?
3. Should existing JSONL analytics remain long-term, or be treated as fallback only once Langfuse is stable?
4. Do we require end-user visible trace IDs in the Studio UI, or only server logs/API metadata?
5. Is there a required compatibility window for old flow definitions if orchestration metadata is added?
